# ML Compass Guide

Welcome.

ML Compass Guide is an educational project aimed at helping developers, students, and researchers learn machine learning concepts and practices.

> The **main hub for web site:**
> [mlcompassguide.dev](https://mlcompassguide.dev)

This is a personal, long-term project I’m building in my spare time. Since it’s a one-person effort, development will progress step by step.
thank you for your patience and support along the way.

The goal of ML Compass is to be a practical guide and reference point for machine learning. It’s designed to help developers, students, and researchers (as well as myself, while learning) to:

- Navigate core ML concepts quickly.
- Compare algorithms and their use cases across categories.
- Explore code examples in Rust.
- Learn best practices for preprocessing and evaluation.

Thank you for visiting the project!
