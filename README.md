# ML Compass Guide

Welcome to ML Compass.

This is a personal project I’m developing solo in my spare time, mostly during nights after my full-time job. As this is a one-man show, progress might be gradual, so I appreciate your patience and support while I build this resource step by step.

This project is not only meant to help developers, students, and researchers, but also serves as a way for me to deepen my own understanding of machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and evaluation metrics.

ML Compass aims to be a comprehensive, easy-to-use library and guide for machine learning, designed to help users:

- Quickly grasp core ML concepts  
- Compare algorithm use cases across categories  
- Access code examples in multiple programming languages  
- Learn best practices for data preparation and evaluation

> 🌐 This GitHub repository complements the [official web app](https://mlcompassguide.dev), where you can visually explore the decision structure and find algorithms tailored to your needs.

Thank you for visiting and supporting the project!

## 🚧 Project Status

This repository is currently in **active development (MVP stage)**.  
Initial algorithms, articles, and examples are being added gradually.

The first milestone (v0.1) will include:

- ✅ 3–5 of the most commonly used ML algorithms  
- ✅ Implementations in Python or Rust (other languages coming later)  
- ✅ Evaluation metrics such as MSE, MAE, RMSE, R²  
- ✅ Data preprocessing techniques (normalization, scaling, encoding, etc.)  
- ✅ Accompanying articles for each algorithm
